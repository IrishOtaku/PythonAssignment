Welcome to my program for the Python Assignment, I created for converting various Metric Values easily. 


Experimental directory is where the Python is located simply click on that then PythonAssigment to view any files that is needed for it 

You will find screenshots and a program called SingleProgram.py which is a version of the program just in one file, it does not use Pytest that feature is exclusive to the main_program.py that ive split into multiple files, but you can use the version of the program that is all in one file for if you do not have features for pytest or unable to install pytest

Within there be sure to first READMEFIRST.txt as that is a manual or explanation of how to use the program and involvements of who worked on the programn.

Enjoy playing around with it.

Intructions, on how the program works and links to my Github repository if you need it:

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/IrishOtaku/PythonAssignment.git

To download the files, just simply run,

git clone https://github.com/IrishOtaku/PythonAssignment.git

Make sure to cd into the correct directory of your choice of course you could simply download it as a zip file, anything to your personal preference or just use a regular file manager if your on Windows, this is file explorer, MacOS finder, and well Linux well WAY TO MANY other than I would reccomend Thunar or Dolphin.

Ensure you have Python installed, and pytest as well via pip or have a text editor or IDE that supports pytest.

How the program works when you run it:

To start to run the code navigate to main_program.py first because if you run any other of the files the program will not work accordingly.

Once you run the code, you will be prompted with a display of values you can convert from starting from one to ten all for different metric counting we use in our daily lives, and eleven is too quit the program.

As soon as you choose one of the numbers you will be prompted otherwise asked to enter a input of a number you wish to convert

Then when you press, ENTER, for the value you wish to convert the program will convert that whatever you put in, and then you can keep doing that till you quit the program by typing 11 im the program.

And that is how the program works.

Description of who worked on who within the code.

I wrote the code, and my mother helped me write how to use the program and how to structure it in a ellgible manner.

She also helped with the data dictionary and i took care of screenshots.

I was also found out that I was actually assigned a team but actually he was not in till the entire time of my duration as well when I managed to finish the code myself, which I emailed with screenshot I provided.
